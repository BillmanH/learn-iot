# Setting up my local IoT Space using MQTT

My local MQTT device is an Intel Nuc, which I can access via SSH on the local network. `ssh billmanh@{local-ip}`

From there I can install the broker via docker. [The documentation for setup there is pretty good](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto/?tab=description)
