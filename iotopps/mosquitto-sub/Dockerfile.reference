# Mosquitto Subscriber Container
# 
# This is a reference Dockerfile - the deployment uses the official
# eclipse-mosquitto:2.0 image directly without building.
#
# If you need a custom image with additional tools, uncomment and modify:

# FROM eclipse-mosquitto:2.0
# 
# # Install additional utilities if needed
# RUN apk add --no-cache \
#     curl \
#     jq \
#     bash
# 
# # Copy custom scripts if needed
# # COPY scripts/ /usr/local/bin/
# 
# ENTRYPOINT ["mosquitto_sub"]

# For now, we use the official image directly in deployment.yaml
